            <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
            <p>The use of the Internet pages of the Hauspunkt Visio AG is possible without any indication of personal
                data. However, if a data subject wants to use special services of our enterprise via our website,
                processing of personal data could become necessary. If processing of personal data is necessary and
                there is no legal basis for such processing, we will generally obtain the consent of the data
                subject.</p>
            <p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a
                data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation, and in accordance with
                the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Hauspunkt Visio AG. By means of this
                data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the public about the nature, scope and
                purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed of
                their rights by means of this data protection declaration.</p>
            <p>As the controller, the Hauspunkt Visio AG has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures
                to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. Nevertheless,
                Internet-based data transmissions can always be vulnerable to security risks, so that absolute
                protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transmit personal data
                to us by alternative means, for example by telephone.</p>

            <li><p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
                <p>The data protection declaration of the Hauspunkt Visio AG is based on the notions used by the
                    European Directive and Ordinance when issuing the Data Protection Regulation (DS-GVO). Our privacy
                    policy should be easy to read and understand for the public as well as for our customers and
                    business partners. To ensure this, we would like to explain the terminology used in advance.</p>
                <p>We use the following terms, among others, in this data protection declaration:</p>

                    directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
                    identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the
                    physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
                    person.

                    personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to
                    analyze or predict aspects relating to that natural person's job performance, economic situation,
                    health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or change of location.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pseudonymization</strong><br>Pseudonymization is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal
                    data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
                    information, provided that such additional information is kept separate and is subject to technical
                    and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or
                    identifiable natural person.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Controller or data controller</strong><br>The controller or data processor is the natural or legal person,
                    public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes
                    and means of the processing of personal data. Where the purposes and means of such processing are
                    determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its designation
                    may be provided for under Union or Member State law.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Processor</strong><br>Processor means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which
                    processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

                <li><strong>Recipient</strong><br>Recipient means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to whom
                    personal data are disclosed, whether or not a third party. However, public authorities that may
                    receive personal data in the context of a specific investigative task under Union or Member State
                    law shall not be considered as recipients.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Third party</strong><br>Third party means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
                    other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons authorized to process the
                    personal data under the direct responsibility of the controller or the processor.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consent</strong><br>Consent shall mean any freely given indication of the data subject's wishes for the specific
                    case in an informed and unambiguous manner, in the form of a statement or any other unambiguous
                    affirmative act by which the data subject indicates that he or she consents to the processing of
                    personal data relating to him or her.

            <li><p><strong>Collection of general data and information</strong></p>
                <p>The website of the Hauspunkt Visio AG collects a series of general data and information each time
                        a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information is
                        stored in the log files of the server. The following can be recorded</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>browser types and versions used</li>
                    <li>the operating system used by the accessing system</li>
                    <li>the website from which an accessing system arrives at our website (so-called referrer)</li>
                    <li>the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website</li>
                    <li>the date and time of access to the website</li>
                    <li>an Internet protocol address (IP address)</li>
                    <li>the Internet service provider of the accessing system</li>
                    <li>other similar data and information that serve to avert danger in the event of attacks on
                        our information technology systems.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When using these general data and information, the Hauspunkt Visio AG does not draw any conclusions
                    about the data subject. Rather, this information is required in order to</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to deliver the contents of our website correctly</li>
                    <li>to optimize the contents of our website as well as the advertising for the same</li>
                    <li>to ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the
                        technology of our website
                    </li>
                    <li>to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore, the Hauspunkt Visio AG analyzes anonymously collected data and information on one hand, and on
                the other hand, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, to
                ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server
                log files are stored separately from any personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Contact possibility via the website</strong></p>
                <p>Based on statutory provisions, the website of the Hauspunkt Visio AG contains information that
                    enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which
                    also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject
                    contacts the controller by e-mail or by using a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the
                    data subject will be stored automatically. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a
                    data subject to the controller will be stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data
                    subject. There is no disclosure of this personal data to third parties.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Comment function in the blog on the website.</strong></p>
                <p>The Hauspunkt Visio AG provides users with the possibility to leave individual comments on individual
                    blog contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a portal
                    maintained on a website, usually publicly viewable, in which one or more persons, called bloggers or
                    web bloggers, can post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. The blogposts can
                    usually be commented on by third parties. However, blog posts are only released after manual
                    approval.</p>
                <p>If a data subject leaves a comment in the blog published on this website, in addition to the comments
                    left by the data subject, information on the time of comment entry and the user name (pseudonym)
                    chosen by the data subject will be stored and published. Furthermore, the IP address assigned by the
                    Internet service provider (ISP) of the person concerned is also logged. This storage of the IP
                    address is done for security reasons and in case the data subject violates the rights of third
                    parties by posting a comment or posts illegal content. The storage of this personal data is
                    therefore in the controller's own interest, so that the controller could exculpate itself if
                    necessary in the event of an infringement. There is no disclosure of this collected personal data to
                    third parties, unless such disclosure is required by law or serves the legal defense of the
                    controller.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Privacy policy on the use and application of Google Analytics (with anonymization
                            function).</strong></p>
                <p>The controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this
                    website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the collection, compilation and
                    evaluation of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects,
                    among other things, data on which website a data subject came to a website from (so-called
                    referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was
                    viewed. A web analysis is mainly used for the optimization of a website and for the cost-benefit
                    analysis of internet advertising.</p>
                <p>The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House,
                    Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.</p>
                <p>The controller uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means
                    of this additive, the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and
                    anonymized by Google if access to our Internet pages is from a Member State of the European Union or
                    from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website.
                    Among other things, Google uses the data and information obtained to evaluate the use of our
                    website, to compile online reports for us showing the activities on our website, and to provide
                    other services related to the use of our website.</p>
                <p>Google Analytics sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What
                    cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze
                    the use of our website. By each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is
                    operated by the controller and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the
                    internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by
                    the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online
                    analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the
                    IP address of the data subject, which Google uses, among other things, to track the origin of
                    visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission calculations.</p>
                <p>By means of the cookie, personal information, for example the access time, the place from which an
                    access originated and the frequency of visits to our website by the data subject, is stored. Each
                    time the data subject visits our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the
                    internet connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of
                    America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may disclose
                    this personal data collected via the technical procedure to third parties.</p>
                <p>The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at
                    any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object
                    to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google
                    from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a
                    cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser or other
                    software programs.</p>

                    controller does not conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents
                    will be automatically deleted two months after notification of the rejection decision, provided that
                    no other legitimate interests of the controller conflict with such deletion. Other legitimate
                    interest in this sense is, for example, a duty to provide evidence in proceedings under the General
                    Equal Treatment Act (AGG).</p>

            <li><p><strong>Data protection provisions on the use and application of Facebook.</strong></p>
                <p>The controller has integrated components of the company Facebook on this website. Facebook is a social
                    network.</p>
                <p>A social network is a social meeting place operated on the Internet, an online community that generally
                    allows users to communicate with each other and interact in virtual space. A social network can serve as a
                    platform for sharing opinions and experiences or enables the Internet community to provide personal or
                    company-related information. Among other things, Facebook enables users of the social network to create
                    private profiles, upload photos and network via friend requests.</p>
                <p>The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. The controller of
                    personal data, if a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada, is Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square,
                    Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
                <p>Each time one of the individual pages of this website operated by the data controller is called up and on which a
                    Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system
                    of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Facebook component to download a representation of the
                    corresponding Facebook component from Facebook. A complete overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at
                    https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE. Within the scope of this technical procedure, Facebook
                    receives knowledge of which specific sub-page of our website is visited by the data subject.</p>
                <p>If the data subject is logged in to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes which specific sub-page of our
                    website the data subject is visiting each time the data subject calls up our website and for the entire duration of
                    the respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Facebook component and assigned by Facebook
                    to the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject activates one of the Facebook buttons
                    integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or if the data subject makes a comment, Facebook assigns
                    this information to the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores this personal data.</p>
                <p>Facebook always receives information via the Facebook component that the data subject has visited our website if the
                    data subject is simultaneously logged into Facebook at the time of calling up our website; this takes place
                    regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the data subject does not want
                    this information to be transmitted to Facebook, he or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her
                    Facebook account before accessing our website.</p>
                <p>The data policy published by Facebook, which can be accessed at https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides
                    information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains which setting
                    options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, various applications are available
                    that make it possible to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the data subject
                    to suppress data transmission to Facebook.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Privacy policy on the use and application of Jetpack for WordPress.</strong></p>
                <p>The controller has integrated Jetpack on this website. Jetpack is a WordPress plug-in that offers
                    additional functions to the operator of a website built on WordPress. Jetpack allows the website
                    operator, among other things, an overview of the visitors to the page. Furthermore, by displaying
                    related posts and publications or the possibility to share content on the page, it is possible to
                    increase the number of visitors. In addition, security features are integrated into Jetpack, so that
                    a website using Jetpack is better protected against brute force attacks. Jetpack also optimizes and
                    speeds up the loading of images integrated on the website.</p>
                <p>The operating company of the Jetpack plug-in for WordPress is Automattic Inc, 132 Hawthorne Street,
                    San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. The operating company uses the tracking technology of Quantcast Inc,
                    201 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.</p>
                <p>Jetpack sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has
                    already been explained above. Each time one of the individual pages of this website operated by the
                    data controller is called up, on which a Jetpack component has been integrated, the Internet browser
                    on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically triggered by the
                    respective Jetpack component to transmit data to Automattic for analysis purposes. As part of this
                    technical process, Automattic obtains knowledge of data that is subsequently used to create an
                    overview of website visits. The data thus obtained is used to analyze the behavior of the data
                    subject who has accessed the website of the controller and is evaluated with the aim of optimizing
                    the website. The data collected via the Jetpack component will not be used to identify the data
                    subject without first obtaining the separate, explicit consent of the data subject. Furthermore, the
                    data comes to the knowledge of Quantcast. Quantcast uses the data for the same purposes as
                    Automattic.</p>
                <p>The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at
                    any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object
                    to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent
                    Automattic/Quantcast from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
                    In addition, cookies already set by Automattic can be deleted at any time via the Internet browser
                    or other software programs.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the data subject has the possibility to object to and prevent the collection of data
                    generated by the Jetpack cookie and related to the use of this website as well as the processing of
                    such data by Automattic/Quantcast. For this purpose, the data subject must press the opt-out button
                    under the link https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/, which sets an opt-out cookie. The opt-out cookie
                    set with the objection is stored on the information technology system used by the data subject. If
                    the cookies on the system of the data subject are deleted after an objection, the data subject must
                    call up the link again and set a new opt-out cookie.</p>
                <p>However, with the setting of the opt-out cookie, there is the possibility that the Internet pages of
                    the controller are no longer fully usable for the data subject.</p>
                <p>The applicable data protection provisions of Automattic are available at

            <li><p><strong>Data protection provisions on the use and application of Twitter.</strong></p>
                <p>The controller has integrated components of Twitter on this website. Twitter is a multilingual
                    publicly accessible microblogging service on which users can publish and distribute so-called
                    tweets, i.e. short messages limited to 280 characters. These short messages can be accessed by
                    anyone, including people who are not registered with Twitter. However, the tweets are also displayed
                    to the so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are other Twitter users who follow the
                    tweets of a user. Furthermore, Twitter makes it possible to address a broad audience via hashtags,
                    links or retweets.</p>
                <p>The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA
                    94103, USA.</p>
                <p>Each time one of the individual pages of this website operated by the controller is called up and on
                    which a Twitter component (Twitter button) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the
                    information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Twitter
                    component to download a representation of the corresponding Twitter component from Twitter. Further
                    information on the Twitter buttons can be found at https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons.
                    Within the scope of this technical procedure, Twitter receives knowledge of which specific sub-page
                    of our website is visited by the data subject. The purpose of integrating the Twitter component is
                    to enable our users to disseminate the content of this website, to make this website known in the
                    digital world and to increase our visitor numbers.</p>
                <p>If the data subject is logged into Twitter at the same time, Twitter recognizes which specific
                    subpage of our website the data subject is visiting with each call to our website by the data
                    subject and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our website. This information is
                    collected by the Twitter component and assigned by Twitter to the respective Twitter account of the
                    data subject. If the data subject activates one of the Twitter buttons integrated on our website,
                    the data and information thus transmitted will be assigned to the personal Twitter user account of
                    the data subject and stored and processed by Twitter.</p>
                <p>Twitter always receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has visited our
                    website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into Twitter at the time of calling up our
                    website; this takes place regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Twitter component or
                    not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to Twitter, he or she can
                    prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her Twitter account before accessing our

            <li><p><strong>Data protection provisions on the use and application of YouTube.</strong></p>
                <p>The controller has integrated components of YouTube on this website. YouTube is an Internet video
                    portal that allows video publishers to post video clips free of charge and other users to view, rate
                    and comment on them, also free of charge. YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos,
                    which is why complete film and TV shows, but also music videos, trailers or videos made by users
                    themselves can be accessed via the Internet portal.</p>
                <p>The operating company of YouTube is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube,
                    LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.</p>
                <p>By each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and
                    on which a YouTube component (YouTube video) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the
                    information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective YouTube
                    component to download a representation of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube. Further
                    information on YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/. Within the scope of
                    this technical procedure, YouTube and Google receive knowledge of which specific sub-page of our
                    website is visited by the data subject.</p>
                <p>If the data subject is logged into YouTube at the same time, YouTube recognizes which specific
                    sub-page of our website the data subject is visiting by calling up a sub-page that contains a
                    YouTube video. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective
                    YouTube account of the data subject.</p>
                <p>YouTube and Google always receive information via the YouTube component that the data subject has
                    visited our website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into YouTube at the time of calling
                    up our website; this takes place regardless of whether the data subject clicks on a YouTube video or
                    not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to YouTube and Google, he
                    or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her YouTube account before accessing
                    our website.</p>

            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Legal basis of the processing</strong></p>
                <p>Article 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations in which we
                    obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary
                    for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example,
                    with processing operations that are necessary for a delivery of goods or the provision of another
                    service or consideration, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. b DS-GVO. The same applies to
                    such processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures,
                    for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a
                    legal obligation by which a processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the
                    fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GVO. In rare cases,
                    the processing of personal data might become necessary to protect vital interests of the data
                    subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were to be
                    injured on our premises and as a result his or her name, age, health insurance data or other vital
                    information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing
                    would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GVO.</p>
            <p>Finally, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GVO. Processing operations that are
                not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is
                necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests,
                fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overridden. Such processing operations are
                permitted to us in particular because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In
                this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a
                customer of the controller (Recital 47, Sentence 2 DS-GVO).</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Legitimate interests in the processing pursued by the controller or a third party.</strong></p>
                <p>If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO, our legitimate interest is the
                    conduct of our business for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Duration for which the personal data are stored.</strong></p>
                <p>The criterion for the duration of the storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
                    After expiry of the period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, provided that it is no longer required
                    for the fulfillment or initiation of the contract.</p>
            <li><p><strong>Legal or contractual provisions for the provision of personal data; necessity for the
                            conclusion of the contract; obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data;
                            possible consequences of non-provision.</strong></p>
                <p>We inform you that the provision of personal data is sometimes required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or may also
                    result from contractual regulations (e.g. information on the contractual partner).</p>
                <p>Sometimes, in order to conclude a contract, it may be necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data
                    that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data
                    if our company concludes a contract with him or her. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the
                    contract with the data subject could not be concluded.</p>
                <p>Before providing personal data by the data subject, the data subject must contact one of our employees. Our employee
                    will explain to the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of the personal data is required by
                    law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the
                    personal data, and what the consequences of not providing the personal data would be.</p>
